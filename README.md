## Description

This project transforms a fully functional Google Books API search engine into a more efficient and dynamic application. Originally built with a RESTful API, this Book Search Engine is refactored to utilize a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The core features of this refactoring involve setting up an Apollo Server to replace the RESTful API, adapting the authentication middleware for GraphQL, and deploying the application to Heroku.
